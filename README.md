#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software systems in a structured and efficient way. For example, the apps on our phones, the websites we visit are all created by software engineers. Some of the benefits of software engineering are: 
- Drives innovations as many industries like healthcare rely on new software solutions to improve services and automate tasks.
- Improves user experience as software engineers make apps and websites user-friendly, ensuring people can navigate without frustration.
- Creates reliable software as without proper engineering, software can be full of bugs or be vulnerable to cyberattacks.
- Enables scalability as startups and big companies need software that can grow their businness.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Before 1968, writing software was unorganized, and many projects failed because they were too complex. In 1968, the term "software engineering" was introduced at a conference to encourage structured ways of developing software, just like in traditional engineering.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s)
Early programming was based on step-by-step instructions, which became hard to manage as software grew larger. Object-oriented programming (OOP) introduced the idea of breaking programs into "objects" that represent real-world things, making software easier to develop and maintain. Examples of OOP languages include Java and C++.
3. The Agile Revolution (2000s - Present)
Traditional software development followed a strict step-by-step process, but this was slow and inflexible. Agile methods, like Scrum and Kanban, introduced a flexible way of working in small steps, allowing teams to make changes quickly based on user feedback. This is now widely used in software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - This is the planning stage where developers talk to users and stakeholders to understand what the software should do.
2. Design - a blueprint of the software is created. This includes choosing the system architecture, database structure, and user interface design.
3. Implementation - This is the actual coding phase, where developers write the software using a programming language.
4. Testing - After coding, the software is checked for errors (bugs).
5. Deployment - Once the software passes testing, it is released for users. This can involve installing it on users' computers, making it available online, or putting it on an app store.
6. Maintenance - After deployment, the software needs updates and fixes to improve performance, add new features, or fix any issues users experience.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method follows a step by step process whereas Agile methodology uses a flexible process. Agile methodology is flexible thus changes can be made anytime whereas Waterfall methodolgy is rigid thus changes are difficult once a phase is completed. In waterfall methodolgy feedback is given at the end whereas agile methodolgy customers give feedback throughout development.
Waterfall Method
- Building a Hospital Management System - If a hospital wants a system to manage patient records, billing, and appointments, Waterfall is ideal. Since the system needs strict regulations, a structured and well-documented approach ensures it is built correctly.
Agile method
- Developing a Social Media App - If a startup wants to create a social media app, Agile is better. Since user preferences change quickly, developers can release a basic version, get feedback, and keep improving the app in small updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer is in charge of writing the code that makes the software work.
Responsibilities:
- Develops and maintains software using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.
- Translates project requirements into functional applications.
- Fixes bugs and improves performance.
- Collaborates with designers and testers to ensure a smooth user experience.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures the software works correctly and meets quality standards.
Responsibilities:
- Tests the software for bugs and errors before release.
- Writes test cases and test plans to check if features work as expected.
- Reports bugs to developers and ensures they are fixed.
- Uses automated testing tools to speed up testing.
3. Project Manager (PM) oversees the project to ensure it is completed on time and within budget.
Responsibilities:
- Plans and assigns tasks to team members.
- Tracks project progress and manages deadlines.
- Communicates with stakeholders (clients, management, developers).
- Solves problems and ensures the team stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:
- Makes coding easier with features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
- Provides built-in debugging tools to find and fix errors.
- Helps manage large projects with code organization tools.
Examples of IDEs: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm
Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
- Keeps a history of changes, so mistakes can be undone easily.
- Helps in team collaboration by managing different versions of the software.
Examples of VCS: Git, Subversion (SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging and Fixing Bugs
Challenge: Code errors can cause software failures, and some bugs are hard to find.
Solution: Use debugging tools (like breakpoints in IDEs), write unit tests, and follow a systematic approach to identifying issues.
2. Keeping Up with New Technologies
Challenge: Technology evolves fast, making it hard to stay updated.
Solution: Follow tech blogs, take online courses, and participate in coding communities like GitHub or Stack Overflow.
3. Time Management and Meeting Deadlines
Challenge: Projects often have tight deadlines, leading to stress.
Solution: Use Agile methods like Scrum, break tasks into smaller milestones, and use project management tools (e.g., Trello, Jira).
4. Working with Large Codebases
Challenge: Understanding and modifying a huge codebase can be overwhelming.
Solution: Follow good coding practices, write clear documentation, and use code navigation features in IDEs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - Testing individual components of a program. It helps find small errors early before they affect the whole system. Example include a banking app developer tests the “calculate interest” function to ensure it gives the correct result.
2. Integration testing - Checking if different modules or components work well together. It ensures that combined parts of the software function as expected. Example include an e-commerce app, testing if the payment system correctly interacts with the shopping cart and order confirmation modules.
3. Sytem testing - Testing the entire software as a complete system. It ensures all features work correctly on real devices or environments. Example include checking if a new hospital management system can handle multiple users, appointments, and billing processes smoothly.
4. Acceptance testing - The final test to verify if the software meets customer or business requirements. It confirms the software is ready for release and satisfies the user’s needs. Example include a client tests a food delivery app to ensure orders, payments, and deliveries work correctly before launching it to customers.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining text inputs (prompts) to get the best possible responses from AI models like ChatGPT. It involves structuring questions or commands in a way that guides the AI to produce accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.
Prompt Engineering Importantance
- Improves AI Accuracy as well-structured prompts help AI generate more precise and relevant answers.
- Enhances Productivity as it helps users get the desired information faster by reducing trial and error.
- Enables Creativity as it allows users to generate high-quality content, such as stories, code, and summaries.
- Optimizes AI for Different Tasks as tailored prompts can make AI useful for research, automation, and decision-making.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt: "Explain how electric cars work, including their advantages and disadvantages, in simple terms."
